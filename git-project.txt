In your unicentral/back directory, run

# Make sure your current python version 3.8.5
python3 -m venv $(pwd)/venv # sets up python virtual environment (do this only once)
source venv/bin/activate # switch your shell into your newly created python virtual environment. (use this command to switch into your virtual env)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # installs all the application's dependencies while in your python virtual environment.

# To start up backend, run:
docker-compose up -d # starts up the backend database.

    Use datagrip to connect to your database on port 5432 with the username and password listed in the .env file in your project root folder.

    Within the unicentral database, create two schemas called admin and structure.
